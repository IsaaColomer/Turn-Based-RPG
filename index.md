## _1.- Differences in turn-based games:_
  There are two differentiated classes:
     - Simultaneous.
     - Sequential.

  Simultaneous games are those in which players make decisions without knowing what other players have decided to do.
  Sequential games, also called IGOUGO, can be subdivided into three sections, ranked, round-robin start, and random.

  The ranked games are those in which the first player is the one who always starts first.
  The round-robins are decided by elimination.
  The random ones in which the first player is decided randomly.

## _2.- Different kinds of turn-based combat systems:_

 ### _2.1.- Active Time Battle_
   First introduced by Hiroyuki Ito in Final Fantasy IV, also in Chrono Trigger, he turns of the people playing are determined by
   a counter that is restarted each time an action is performed.

### _2.2.- Timed Turns_
   This methodology exists to solve a question, how long a player's turn can last? Basically, each player has a limited time to perform
   an action.

### _2.3.- Phase Based Turns_
   Also called We-Go, in this class of combat there are two distinct phases: decision phase and execution phase. In the decision phase each
   player decides that they will do their units, in the execution phase the units perform the previously chosen actions simultaneously.

### _2.4.- Unit initiative_
   In this case the sequence of attacks depends on the initiative, which is an attribute of each unit.

### _2.5.- Actions outside a turn_
   In some games like the saga X-How the players are allowed to act outside their turn, to be able to do it each unit must have, a minimum
   amount of points to be able to interrupt the other player and the actions that can carry out are limited by the number of points of the
   unit.

### _2.6.- Special phases or actions_
   In some turns players are required to follow certain rules set by the game, such as not attacking or moving all units.

### _2.7.- Classic Turn Based Game_
   Players playing can spend all the time they want thinking about how to execute their next action, nothing in the game will move until
   they decide what to do.

### _2.8.- Real-Time Based Games_
   In another sphere, real-time based games the player timer matches with the game timer, that means that the action in the game is
   continued.

### _2.9.- Extra Point_
   It must be said that many games have a combination of real-time and turn-based combat. Such as Total War and Jagged Alliance 2.

## _3.- Pros & Cons_

### _3.1.- Pros_
- The fact that there is no time limit for performing an action makes people who donâ€™t like frantic games where you have to think and act fast able to enjoy this kind of games. This does not mean that the games are easy because in this class of games the AI must decide a smaller number of actions in comparison, for example, to the - AI of FPS games, and this means that you can code the AI to increase the difficulty in harder modes of the game.
- In turn-based combat games the difficulty curve is suitable for each player as they can practice as many times as they want.

### _3.2.- Cons_
- It could be argued that they are unrealistic games because in a battle, for example, you do not have a certain amount of time to act.
  it can be debated whether turn-based combat games are more or less immersive than real-time combat games.
- Real-time combat games are more multiplayer-friendly than turn-based games.
